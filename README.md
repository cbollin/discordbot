# discordbot

Most commands only work if you're set as Mod or Owner roles.

Commands include:
* ~say [text] -repeats what was said
* ~hello -bot says hello + username
* ~youtube [number] -statement + number input (also works with strings atm)
* ~delete [number] -deletes the last text entered up to the number given
* ~kick [user] -kicks user from server(guild)
* ~botver -replys with bot version

You may host this bot on a node server. Eventual plan is to set this up on a Raspberry PI.
